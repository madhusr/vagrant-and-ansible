Code samples on how to use Vagrant to provision virtual machines and configuring those VM's using Ansible

This project mainly hosts code samples on how to use Vagrant to provision virtual machines using Hyper-V as the hypervisor and configuring 
the virtual machines using Ansible configuration management tool. 

Disclaimer : There are lot discussion on the need of Vagrant in the presence of other alternatives. This project is not about addressing any of the questions 
             around those concerns instead it is only for education purpose and as a future reference.
